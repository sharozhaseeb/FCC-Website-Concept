			<h2>FCCU’s Current Student Body</h2>
			<p>
			Forman Christian College (A Chartered University) welcomes students from across Pakistan and beyond. From a Forman perspective, a diverse student population that “looks like Pakistan” is one of its strongest assets. This diversity extends to include students from all socio-economic groups, ethnic backgrounds, religious communities and geographic regions of the country.

            UNIVERSITY (BACCALAUREATE AND POST-GRADUATE)

            According to figures collected in Spring 2021, university enrollment at Forman totaled 5,114 students, of whom 2,308 (45 percent) were female and 2,806 (55 percent) were male. Female representation was highest at the post-graduate level at 68 percent, with 350 out of a total of 517 being women.

            While Forman students at the university level predominantly come from Punjab (96 percent), Forman also attracts representation from Sind, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Northern Areas. Also, 12 percent (605 students) of Forman’s student population are from the country’s minority Christian community
			</p>
			<h2>Our History</h2>
			<p>
			Forman Christian College was founded in 1864 by Dr Charles W Forman, a Presbyterian missionary from the USA. The college was initially known as the Lahore Mission College, but in 1894 the name was officially changed to Forman Christian College in honor of the founder. In the early years, degrees were awarded through the Calcutta University. College level instruction was interrupted in 1869 due to the illness of key faculty members. College classes resumed in 1886, with degrees being awarded through the University of the Punjab. In 2004, FCCU became a chartered University and from 2009 onwards has awarded its own degrees.

            The early years of the college were marked by rapid growth in enrollment, and a constant struggle to find enough space to house the growing college. Enrollment grew from 18 students in 1886 to 130 in 1890, 311 in 1900, 426 in 1910 and 600 in 1915. Enrollment had reached 1,500 students by the time the college was nationalized in 1972. Enrollment in the University section alone stands at 3,200 students today.

            The campus was located in the Anarkali (Nila Gumbad) area of Lahore for many years. Four major buildings were constructed by the college on that campus by 1916, and Ewing Hall, built in 1916, is still used as a hostel by the college. In 1940 the college moved to its present spacious campus of over 100 acres on the scenic banks of Lahore Canal.

            FCCU has been served by a large number of distinguished educational leaders and teachers throughout its history. Dr CW Forman, Dr Sir JCR Ewing, Dr CH Rice, Dr ED Lucas, Dr SK Dutta, Dr HC Velte, Dr JH Orbison, Noble Laureate Dr Arthur Compton, Maulvi Muhammad Bakar, Dr HD Griswold, Prof JM Benade, Shamsul Ulema Maulavi Muhammad Hussain, Dr KC Chatterji, Dr P Carter Speers, Dr SL Sheets, Prof MS Bhatti, Maulana Farzand Ali, Dr RH Ewing, Dr EJ Sinclair, Dr Robert F Tebbe and Dr Carl Wheeless are among many who have impacted the lives of students and shaped the future of the college through the years. Under their leadership, the college became widely regarded as one of the very best in the entire subcontinent. </p>

			<h2>Be Part of Our Community</h2>
			<p>
			In 1972 the college was nationalized by the government. It was returned to the present owners of the college on 19 March 2003. In March 2004, the government granted University status to FCCU. The University embarked upon an exciting new stage in its history in September 2005 when it began a four-year Baccalaureate (Honors) program designed in accordance with world-class standards for accreditation.

            Academic excellence and the preparation of leaders who understand the value of service have been the hallmarks of education at the institution since its inception. One of the premier colleges of the subcontinent, FCCU has distinguished itself through its remarkable graduates and the achievements of its faculty. It has built a reputation for providing outstanding education with innovation and pioneering work in its curriculum, admission policies, a range of extracurricular activities, and the rigor of its academic programs.

            Informed learners who understand global and cross-cultural relationships, value the philosophy and history underlying the nation of Pakistan, and are fluent in both their native language and English.
            Responsible learners who understand the ethical consequences of actions and are well-groomed to be active citizens who accept their public duty and participate in the decision-making process of a democracy.
