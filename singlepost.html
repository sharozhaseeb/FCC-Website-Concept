					<h2>Message From The Dean</h2>
					<p>
					Since the upgradation of FCC to a University, it is being developed on modern lines to give due importance to research while meeting all the requirements of liberal arts education. 
					In order to meet the objectives of a University, the faculty at FCCU is actively engaged in a great variety of ongoing research activities and projects. 
					Efforts have been made to encourage multi and interdisciplinary approach to research. 
					These activities span the entire range of all of the disciplines that are represented at FCCU namely Humanities, Social and Natural Sciences, Business, Public Policy, and Education. 
					We have initiated postgraduate programs in all these disciplines.
					</p>
					<p>
					Our faculty in all disciplines have attracted considerable external funding to support the research activities. FCCU has also established an Internal Research Innovation Fund (IRIF) to support faculty and students for small research projects.
					In addition, a special emphasis is being placed on entrepreneurship through establishing the Office of Research, Innovation and Commercialization (ORIC).
					</p>
					<p>
					Our research produces new discoveries and insights, and makes contributions to numerous applications that benefit society.  
					Such results of our research by faculty and students are regularly showcased among the faculty, entrepreneurs, and civil society, and in due time we will establish a business incubator to facilitate commercialization of results.
					</p>

					<h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
					<p>
						&ldquo; To promote strategic partnership with industry in global knowledge economy to intensify the partnerships that go beyond the traditional funding of discrete research projects<br>
                                To promote entrepreneurship, technology-transfer and commercialization activities that energize and support the local and national economy&rdquo;

					<h2>Excellence Through Learning</h2>
					<p>
					The connection between FCCU and the teaching of English has a very long history. FCCU evolved from the Mission School, which was established in 1849 as the first English-medium school in Lahore.
					In 1864 a College section was started, which was later renamed Forman Christian College after its founder. 
					By 1901, FCCU had started English MA classes. The English Department has benefitted from the teaching of great scholars such as Dr HC Velte, Dr FM Velte, Rev HD Griswold, Dr EJ Sinclair and Dr SL Sheets. The graduates of the English Department have distinguished themselves as writers, poets, civil servants, judges, lawyers, diplomats, politicians, and entrepreneurs.

					<h2>About the Institutional Review Board</h2>

			        <p>
				    The Forman Christian College University  Institutional Review Board (IRB) is charged with reviewing human and animal subjects research. FCCU is committed to protect the rights, welfare, and privacy of individuals participating as subjects in research.

                    The FCCU- IRB is guided by the ethical principles set forth in the Belmont Report, federal regulations (e.g. DHHS regulations 45 CFR Part 46), state or local laws, and College policies. In accordance with these principles, the IRB strives to create a culture of respect for, and awareness of, the rights and welfare of research participants.

                    Fulfilling our obligation to uphold the ethical principles and regulations is critical for several reasons:

                    Compliance with the procedures outlined by the regulations provides research subjects protection from harm that might result from their participation in research.
                    Compliance with these procedures improves the overall quality of the research conducted at FCCU.
                    Acknowledgment of the issues inherent to human subject’s research and compliance with the regulations guiding human subjects research will allow faculty and student to continue to conduct research on meaningful and culturally relevant topics.
                    Many of the concepts outlined in the codes of conduct and ethical principles for research are equivalent to the core values of FCCU,including intellectual inquiry, social responsibility, civic engagement, and cultural awareness. Therefore, the protection of human subjects is a necessary mean to uphold those values.
					</p>
					<h2>Software Engineering Research Group (SERG)</h2>
					<p>
					The research interests of Software Engineering research group at the Forman Christian College (A Chartered University) cover both the software development and maintenance activities. Our foremost priority is to promote the software engineering research at the undergraduate and graduate level within our University. Second, we develop tools and techniques to equip developers for better engineering software systems. 
					We investigate product, processes and people in software engineering.”
					</p>
					<h2>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) Research Group</h2>
					<p>
			
                    The Artificial Intelligence group at FCCU is actively involved in foundational research in core areas of knowledge representation, information retrieval, reasoning, learning, planning, decision-making, speech and language processing, pattern recognition, text mining and optimization. 
				    The group’s focus is on practically exploring all machine learning aspects like deep learning, natural language processing and classical algorithms. The group research addresses the central challenges of machine cognition, both from a theoretical perspective and application perspective.
                    The group is also aimed at applying intelligent algorithms to applied problems in areas like bioinformatics, search and information retrieval.
